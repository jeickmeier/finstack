"""
Core financial primitives: dates, currencies, money, market data, math.

Bindings for the ``finstack-quant-core`` Rust crate.  Each submodule is
re-exported here and registered in ``sys.modules`` so that both
``from finstack_quant.core import dates`` and ``import finstack_quant.core.dates``
work transparently.

Examples
--------
>>> from finstack_quant.core import dates
>>> dates.Tenor.parse("3M").months
3

    Base class for every named exception this library defines.

    ``except FinstackError`` catches ``AnalyticsError``, ``PortfolioError``
    and its subclasses, and ``ContractValidationError`` and its subclasses.
    It inherits ``ValueError`` so that code written before this base existed
    keeps working unchanged.

    Note
    ----
    Errors mapped from core failures are still raised as plain ``ValueError``
    or ``KeyError``, so ``except FinstackError`` is narrower than "anything
    this library can raise".

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from finstack_quant.core import FinstackError
    >>> issubclass(FinstackError, ValueError)
    True
