//! # Convention
//!
//! Rate/spread quote shocks use the valuations-owned
//! [`QuoteBump`](finstack_quant_valuations::recalibration::QuoteBump).
//! Direct curve and surface shocks use core `BumpSpec`/`Bumpable` instead.
//!
//! # Calibration policy
//!
//! Stored rate-calibration recipes retain the quote set, method, curve role,
//! day count, and OIS convention needed by the
//! `*_from_rate_calibration` entry points. Synthetic bump helpers operate
//! directly on curve knots and do not recalibrate.
//!
//! ## Induced-error bound
//!
//! For recalibrated bumps, both the base curve and the bumped curve reprice
//! every input quote to within their respective calibration tolerances, so residual leakage into a
//! sensitivity is bounded by roughly the **sum of the two repricing tolerances
//! divided by the bump size**. With the default `1e-8` fit tolerance and a 1bp
//! bump this is on the order of `2e-8 / 1e-4 ≈ 2e-4` of the PV unit.
