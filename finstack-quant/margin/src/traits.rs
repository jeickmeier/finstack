/// Trait for instruments that support margin calculations.
///
/// This is a standalone trait so `finstack-quant-margin` has no dependency on
/// `finstack-quant-valuations`. Concrete implementations live in valuations as a
/// bridge layer.
///
/// # Conventions
///
/// - [`Self::mtm_for_vm`] returns the current mark-to-market in instrument or
///   reporting currency units, not basis points.
/// - [`Self::im_exposure_base`] returns an explicit regulatory notional,
///   CCP scan-risk proxy, or other methodology-specific exposure base for
///   percentage-of-exposure IM calculators. It must not fall back to current
///   MtM unless that is explicitly the regulatory exposure input for the
///   instrument.
/// - [`Self::simm_sensitivities`] must return sensitivities in the units
///   documented by [`crate::SimmSensitivities`], especially for DV01/CS01-style
///   inputs where decimal-vs-basis-point mistakes materially change IM.

    /// # Arguments

    /// * `market` - Market data used to produce the sensitivities
    /// * `as_of` - Valuation date for the sensitivity snapshot
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///

    /// sensitivity set for the requested market state.
