//! The three correlation scenarios are applied to the base (Medium)
//! prescribed correlations to produce Low and High stress correlations:
//!
//! ```text
//! MAR21.6(1) Medium: rho as prescribed in MAR21.39 to MAR21.101
//! MAR21.6(2) High:   rho_high = min(1.25 * rho_medium, 100%)
//! MAR21.6(3) Low:    rho_low  = max(2 * rho_medium - 100%, 75% * rho_medium)
//! ```
//!
//! MAR21.7 then takes the **largest** of the three scenario totals, each
//! computed by summing delta, vega and curvature across all risk classes
//! within that scenario.
//!
//! These scaling operations are implemented directly on the
//! `CorrelationScenario` enum in
//! [`types`](crate::regulatory::frtb::types), and pinned by
//! `correlation_scenario_tests` there.
//!
//! # Known deviations from MAR21
//!
//! - **Curvature correlations are only half-squared** (MAR21.100). Curvature
//!   `rho_kl` and `gamma_bc` are the squares of the corresponding delta
//!   parameters. The curvature engine squares the inter-bucket gamma but
//!   passes the intra-bucket rho through unsquared.
//! - **Scenario scaling is applied before squaring** rather than to the
//!   already-squared curvature parameters, so the High scenario multiplies
//!   the curvature gamma by `1.25^2 = 1.5625` where MAR21.100 read with
//!   MAR21.6(2) implies `1.25`.
